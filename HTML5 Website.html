     <div><h3>Why dogs?</h3>
         <p>I got my first dog on the first day of quarantine and she has been such a blessing.  She has brought me such joy and was one of the reasons why I wanted to pursue this degree, so i could spend more time with her. She is a mini Australian Shepherd and if I got a second dog, it would probably be a golden retriever.  That is why I choose those pictures.  the third dog is a Golden Aussie just for kicks.   <!--block-->
